# ✅ 1. Leap Year Checker:
# Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
#
#
#
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
#
# Use an if-else statement to make this determination.


year = int(input("Enter the year "))
if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:
    print("Leap year")
else:

    print("Not a leap year")
